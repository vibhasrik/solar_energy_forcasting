      <abstract>Analysts from the U.S. Geological Survey and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory collaborated to develop and release the United States Large Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (USPVDB). This effort built from the expertise gained while developing the regularly updated United States Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB). Starting from Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, locations of large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSPV) facilities were visually verified using high-resolution aerial imagery; a polygon was drawn around the extent of facility panel arrays, and facility attributes were appended. Quality assurance and control were achieved via team peer review and comparing the USPVDB to other datasets of U.S. solar photovoltaic.  Some facility information did not exist within our source data or not yet built, not built at all, or located elsewhere.  Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain facilities and are rated in a confidence level.  None of the data are field verified. </abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this information is to provide a publicly available, spatially referenced, national dataset of Large Scale Solar Photovoltaic (LSPV) and some of their technical specifications. An appropriate use of the data would be for scientific analysis, research, or for general interest for the public.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The zip files provided within this data release product contain data available in ESRI shapefile format. The user must have software capable of uncompressing the file and displaying the shapefile. In lieu of ArcGIS, the user may utilize another GIS application package capable of importing the data

      <attraccr>Large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSPV) polygons were created and spatially verified using aerial imagery to confirm or edit their correct positions. The map scale used while verifying and digitizing turbines depended on location, need, and imagery availability. Authors used aerial imagery with a typical assessment map scale of 1:2,000 to 1:5,000. None of the spatial verification was done at a map scale smaller than 1:5,000. Uncertainty may exist as indicated in confidence in site location from 1 to 4. Lower values represent a lower confidence. 1- Multiphase facility or multiple Energy Information Administration (EIA) records with identical location. A single polygon is used to represent multiple facilities indistinguishable from one another; attributes may not reflect full scope of facilities. 2- Multiple polygons created, but EIA records are unclear; attributes may not reflect full scope of facilities. 3- Polygon reflects only a part of the facility due to poor image quality; the area of polygon may not reflect the full size of array(s). 4- Facility polygons created with high confidence.</attraccr>

    <complete>Data set is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. Users are advised to read the metadata record carefully for additional details.  We recognize that there exist some number of US LSPV facilities that are not included in the data. However, we do not attempt to append additional sites not in the base EIA 860 data, due to our inability to compile the same level of detailed attributes (e.g., capacity, site name, operational date, etc.).</complete>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The USPVDB dataset creation process consisted of five primary stages, with iterative troubleshooting at several locations: (1) data collection and initial screening, (2) georectifying facility locations, (3) digitizing facility arrays, (4) quality checking and review, and (5) final formatting of the data. Due to the large number of large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSPV) facilities in the US, six analysts shared the digitizing work, generally each working through one state's facilities at a time (and in some cases, splitting a state with many facilities into several groups).  As part of the initial screening, facilities from the EIA data were included if the following criteria were met: (1) generation technology is PV, (2) panels are ground-mounted but are not parking canopy arrays, (3) facility capacity is greater than or equal to 1 MW, and (4) facility can be identified in high-resolution imagery. 

We relied on Maxar Technologies (MT) satellite imagery to determine the extent of solar arrays (https://evwhs.digitalglobe.com/), due to its regularly updated imagery and the convenience of using an EnhancedView Web Hosting Service (EV-WHS) account and plug-in to use the imagery as a base layer within ArcGIS. Maxar data vary in resolution and frequency of imaging across the U.S. Highly populated areas tend to be imaged more frequently than sparsely populated rural areas, such that for some solar facilities, we could select the clearest image from a large set of dates when digitizing, while with others, we had only a single image to work from. Additionally, there is a temporal lag between the date a facility is operational and the most recent images in Maxar, ranging from several months to several years. Because of this delay in imaging, more recently constructed solar projects are less likely to be visible in the available satellite imagery.

We recognize that there exist some number of US LSPV facilities that are not included in the EIA data. However, we do not attempt to append additional sites to the EIA data due to resources and time limits to compile the same level of detailed attributes (e.g., capacity, site name, operational date, etc.).
